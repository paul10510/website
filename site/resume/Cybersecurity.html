            <h2>Cybersecurity Club</h2>
            <p>I joined the Fordham prep Cybersecurity Club during my freshmman year. I fell in love with cybersecurity and want to
                <br>pursue it as a career. As a Sophomore I was the Co-President of the Cybersecurity Club, and now as a Junior/Senior I am the
                <br>President of the Cybersecurity Club.
            </p>

            <h2>Competitions</h2>
            <p>Under my leadership, the Cybersecurity Club competed for the first time in six years. We competed in the National
                <br>Cyber League Competition. There are 9 competitiors that make up two teams. 
                <br>This year the club is planning to participate in some HackTheBox competitions.
                <br>My hope is to inspire these members with a love of Cybersecurity that rivals my own.  
            </p>

            <h2>Meetings</h2>
            <p>Our Cybersecurity Club meetings cover many different topics and can range from a discussion,
                <br>to me bringing in one of my hacking tools and doing a demonstration, or even a presentation from a
                <br>professional in the field. This year we are have had two speakers so far, but plan to have more in the future!
            </p>

            <h2>Outside Activities</h2>
            <p>In order to educate myself about the Cybersecurity world and be a productive president for my club
                <br>I have participated in many outside activities to gain the knowledge that I present to my club members.
                <br> I participated in The National Student Leadership Conference in Washington DC with a focus on Cybersecurity.
                <br>I also attended a class on AI with Fordham University called "Future Leaders in AI", and lastly I took a class
                <br>with Columbia University's highschool program on Blockchain technology.
