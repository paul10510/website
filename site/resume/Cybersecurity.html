            <h2>Cybersecurity Club</h2>
            <p>I joined the Fordham prep Cybersecurity club during my freshmman year. I fell in love with Cybersecurity and want to
                <br>pursue it as a career. As a sophmore I was the Co-Leader of the Cybersecurity club, and now as a Junior I am the
                <br>president of the Cybersecurity club.
            </p>

            <h2>Competitions</h2>
            <p>Under my leadership, the Cybersecurity club is competing for the first timein six years. we are competing in the National
                <br>Cyber League Competition. there are 9 competitiors that make up two teams. my hope is to inspire these members
                <br>with a love of Cybersecurity that rivals my own.
