            <h2>Cybersecurity Club</h2>
            <p>I joined the Fordham prep Cybersecurity club during my freshmman year. I fell in love with Cybersecurity and want to
                <br>pursue it as a career. As a sophmore I was the Co-Leader of the Cybersecurity club, and now as a Junior/Senior I am the
                <br>president of the Cybersecurity club.
            </p>

            <h2>Competitions</h2>
            <p>Under my leadership, the Cybersecurity club is competing for the first time in six years. We competed in the National
                <br>Cyber League Competition. There are 9 competitiors that make up two teams. 
                <br>This year the club is planning to participate in some HackTheBox competitions
                <br>My hope is to inspire these members
                <br>with a love of Cybersecurity that rivals my own.
