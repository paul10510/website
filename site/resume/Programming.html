            <h2>Blinking LEDs</h2>
            <p>The blinking LEDs Project was the project that took my programming
               <br>to the next level. I had already taken some Python and Processing courses 
               <br>in my middle school, which I had been pretty good, and enthusiastic about.
               <br>However, a simple project I did which involved some very basic coding, in a language 
               <br>I knew nothing of, made me crave more knowledge on coding. This led to me learning a 
               <br>language known as C#, which I will talk more about later.</p>

            <h2>C#</h2>
            <img src="C-sharp.jpg" alt="C# Pic" width="672" height="385">
            <p>As I previously stated C# was the first language I really learned. I can now make complex 
               <br>WINFORMS (a style of coding in C#, which is like level two on the difficulty scale, level one being console 
               <br>applications)  apps in a matter of minutes. Before this though, I mastered the Console (shown above). 
               <br>The Console is what you first learn how to use in C#. It teaches you how to take in text from 
               <br>the user, process that text, do something with it, and give an output. The next level of 
               <br>programming in C# is, as I said before, WINFORMS. The best way to learn in coding is by doing projects, 
               <br>and to learn WINFORMS I took on a huge project: BOB.</p>

            <h2>BOB</h2>
            <img src="BOB.jpg" alt="Bob Pic" width="401" height="246">
            <br>
            <span>Bob is my personal assistant. I fully customized him to my needs, and he is the best programming 
               <br>achievement I have completed so far. He was my introduction to WINFORMS. I have included a download 
               <br>for him <a href="Bob.zip" id="greentext">here</a>. To use him, download,  open and extract the .zip folder, and run the 
               <br>program; speech recognition.exe.  When the program opens say, “Show Commands.” On the program a list 
               <br>of commands will pop up. Some commands may not work as they are custom to my PC. </span>

            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>I am currently in the AP Computer Science A class at Fordham Prep, where we are learning the Java programming language
                <br>projects and things like that writeen in Java and other languages as a result of this cource can be found on my
                <br>github. My username is <a href="https://github.io/paul10510" id="greentext">paul10510</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>
                I am alos proficient in the programming lanuage Python. I learned python to be more advanced at reading scripts
                <br> for cyber security, and it is now one of my favorite languages that I have learned. Projects can be found on my github.
            </p>

            <h2>Other Languages</h2>
            <p>In the furure I intend to learn more Javascript to create more advanced websites. I also plan to learn Node.JS with react
                <br>so I can also understand and work in the back-end of development.
