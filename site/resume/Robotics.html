            <p>I was an inaugural member of the Rippowam Cisqua Robotics Team (Ripp Robotics).  
            <br>The team began while I was in 6th grade and I participated through 8th grade.  
            <br>It was part of the First Lego League (FLL) program.</p>

            <p>My job on the team was to program the robots.  In my 3 years on the team, I 
                <br>programmed a sumo-wrestling bot and coded many of the jobs that the robot 
                <br>did during our competitions.</p>

            <p>Each year we participated in Robotics competitions with teams from all over Westchester 
               <br>County, Putnam County and Dutchess County, NY.  We came in 4th place twice!</p>
