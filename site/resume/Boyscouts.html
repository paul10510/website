        <h1 id="greentextcenter" style="font-size: 100px">Boy Scouts</h1>

        <div id="greentextcenter">
            <p>I have been a Boy Scout / Cub Scout for seven  
               <br>years. During that time I rose to the rank of Eagle Scout at 14.</p>
            
            <br>
            <p>All Boy Scouts have the opportunity to earn Merit Badges.  
                <br>Today there are over 130 merit badges available in a wide range 
                <br>of topics which span from rifle shooting to basketry. A Scout earns 
                <br>these badges after completing a number of activities and demonstrating 
                <br>excellence in the certain area of study.  The purpose of these 
                <br>badges is to allow Scouts to discover more about certain subjects 
                <br>and explore potential career opportunities. Each Merit Badge is 
                <br>taught/led by a Merit Badge Counselor that has expertise in that area.  
                <br>For example, my father is an Assistant Scout Master in my Troop.  
                <br>He is a practicing attorney and is the Merit Badge counselor for the 
                <br>Law Merit Badge as well as a number of others. Along with the Merit 
                <br>Badge Workbook, there is a Worksheet that the Scout completes to ensure 
                <br>that he has achieved all of the requirements for the badge. Merit 
                <br>badges can be earned during troop meetings, at summer camp or at Merit Badge days.</p>

            <p>Some sample Merit Badge booklets are below:</p>

            <p>In order to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest 
            <br>rank in Boy Scouts, a Scout needs to earn 21 Merit Badges.  
            <br>There are 13 badges that are required, and 8 the Scout can choose from the Merit Badges offered. 
            <br>The required 13 are:</p>

            <p>My favorite Merit Badges include Citizenship in the Community and Fishing.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>The CitizenShip in the Community Merit Badge is one of my favorite Merit Badges
                <br>as it provides an oppurtinity for the scout to learn how to be a 
                <br>productive member of thier community who will engage in service for others.

            <br>
            <p>The fishing Merit Badge is also one of my favorite Badges. Fishing has been one of my
                <br>favorite pastimes for many years now. I am the fishing
                <br>specialist at Kiwi Country Day Camp, teaching kids how to fish over the summer.

            <p>During the COVID pandemic, our troop had meetings virtually.  
                <br>Since I had some time, I decided that I wanted to earn the Programming 
                <br>Merit Badge.  I learned a new programming language (C#), completed all 
                <br>of the requirements and built a program that self-populated the 
                <br>answers to the questions on the Merit Badge worksheet.</p>
