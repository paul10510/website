            <p>As most fisherman do, I do most of my fishing on my own time, when I want to. I usually 
                <br>fish for Bass, but sometimes I will fish for Carp or Sunfish. I have only been deep 
                <br>sea fishing once. I went with my friend, his older brother, and my dad in Rhode Island. 
                <br>That day I caught two Sea Robins, and some Black Sea Bass.</p>

            <p>I also do a lot of fishing as part of my summer job at a local day camp. 
               <br>I work there as a fishing counselor teaching kids from the ages of 5 to 13 the basics of fishing. 
               <br>There we normally catch Sunfish, but the more experienced fishermen will also catch 
               <br>some Smallmouth Bass. There are also times when the kids will catch Snapping Turtles, 
               <br>and I must deal with those.</p>
