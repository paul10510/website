            <p>As most fisherman do, I do most of my fishing on my own time, when I want to. I usually 
                <br>fish for Bass, but sometimes I will fish for Carp or Sunfish. I have only been deep 
                <br>sea fishing three times. One of these trips was a sailing trip for 6 days at 
                <br>SeaBase in the Florida keys with my Scout troop. We sailed out in the Florida keys
                <br>for 6 days only stoping at a marina once. We got to catch many fish including a bluefin
                <br>tuna I caught!

            <p>I also do a lot of fishing as part of my summer job at a local day camp. 
               <br>I work there as a fishing specialist teaching kids from the ages of 5 to 13 the basics of fishing. 
               <br>There we normally catch Sunfish, but the more experienced fishermen will also catch 
               <br>some largemouth Bass. There are also times when the kids will catch Snapping Turtles, 
               <br>and I must deal with those (we usually find some other lake where we can release them and they
               <br>will not hurt anyone).</p>
