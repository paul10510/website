        <div id="greentextcenter">
            <p>I have been a Boy Scout with my local Troop for three and a half 
               <br>years. During that time I have risen to the rank of Eagle. 
               <br>I am currently the Senior patrol leader of my troop.</p>
            
            <br>
            <p>All Boy Scouts have the opportunity to earn Merit Badges.  
                <br>Today there are over 130 merit badges available in a wide range 
                <br>of topics which span from rifle shooting to basketry. A Scout earns 
                <br>these badges after completing a number of activities and demonstrating 
                <br>excellence in the certain area of study.  The purpose of these 
                <br>badges is to allow Scouts to discover more about certain subjects 
                <br>and explore potential career opportunities. Each Merit Badge is 
                <br>taught/led by a Merit Badge Counselor that has expertise in that area.  
                <br>For example, my father is an Assistant Scout Master in my Troop.  
                <br>He is a practicing attorney and is the Merit Badge counselor for the 
                <br>Law Merit Badge as well as a number of others. Along with the Merit 
                <br>Badge Workbook, there is a Worksheet that the Scout completes to ensure 
                <br>that he has achieved all of the requirements for the badge. Merit 
                <br>badges can be earned during troop meetings, at summer camp or at merit badge days.</p>

            <p>Some sample merit badge booklets are below:</p>

            <p>In order to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest 
            <br>rank in Boy Scouts, a Scout needs to earn 21 merit badges.  
            <br>There are 13 badges that are required, and 8 the Scout can choose from the merit badges offered. 
            <br>The required 13 are:</p>

            <p>My favorite merit badges include Archery, Reptile and Amphibian Studies and Programming.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>The Archery Merit Badge was one of the first badges I earned.  
               <br>I have done a lot of archery at summer camp and during my first 
               <br>summer attending Boy Scout summer camp, I was able to earn that badge.</p>

            <br>
            <p>While at summer camp I earned my Reptile and Amphibian Studies 
               <br>merit badge.  We found snakes and amphibians under rocks and identified 
               <br>them as part of earning this badge.</p>

            <p>During the COVID pandemic, our troop has been meeting virtually.  
                <br>Since I had some time, I decided that I wanted to earn the Programming 
                <br>Merit Badge.  I learned a new programming language (C#), completed all 
                <br>of the requirements and built a program that self-populated the 
                <br>answers to the questions on the worksheet.</p>
