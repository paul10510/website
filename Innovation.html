            <h2>Sand Pool Project</h2>
            
            <!--Video of one of my projects-->

            <br>
            <span> The sand pool project was my first project to make headlines. I had 
                   <br>seen a great video from the Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/onemeeeliondollars">Mark Rober</a>, 
                   <br>and wanted to recreate what he did, but on a smaller scale. I did this 
                   <br>project in my middle school's Innovation Center, and the video my teacher 
                   <br>took of the project went on the school website.

            <h2>The LEV</h2>
            <img src="LEV.png" alt="Lev Pic" width="500" height="240">
            <p>LEV (Lunar Excursion Vehicle): The LEV was another of my middle school projects, 
               <br>but this one was for a class as a project. I had to have minimal hiccups with this 
               <br>project, as I would be receiving a grade for it. Sadly, this project did not make it to 
               <br>the school website, as I finished it the day before the COVID â€“ 19 lockdowns hit. 
               <br>LEV stands for Lunar Excursion Vehicle, and the project was designed to be used by people on 
               <br>the moon. It ran on all electricity, and could do two laps around the school, without stopping 
               <br>for a charge. The LEV was my greatest, and last achievement in the Innovation Center, where I 
               <br>spent so much time during my middle school years.</p>
